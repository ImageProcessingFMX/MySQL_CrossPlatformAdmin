# MySQL_CrossPlatformAdmin
a  very  MYSQL admin , database explorer  tool,  used to evaluate  a cross platform DB access (WIN/LINUX)  

phpadmin might be better and offer more functions ...   here i just implemented a DB connection  and some basic eval of DB parameters using FIREDAC. 
execute SQL scripts is all  that need. 
If someone want#s to contribute ....  pls feed free to extent this basic code fragment
